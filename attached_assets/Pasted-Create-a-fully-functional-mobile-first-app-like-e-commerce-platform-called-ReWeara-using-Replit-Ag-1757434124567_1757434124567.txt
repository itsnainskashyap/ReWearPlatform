Create a fully functional, mobile-first, app-like e-commerce platform called ReWeara using Replit Agent. Build this iteratively: Start by setting up the project with the specified tech stack, create an MVP with core pages (Home, Shop, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout), then add advanced features (admin panel, AI integrations, PWA), using checkpoints after each major step for safe experimentation. Provide clear, concise prompts for each iteration, including code snippets or examples where needed, and specify outputs like file structures. Use positive, direct language, curate context by referencing previous steps, and refine as needed. Ensure the app is professional, error-free, with an easy-to-use interface, no fake data (start empty, populate via admin), and full admin control over everything via API-driven real-time updates.
The platform is both a Thrift Store and a ReWeara Originals Clothing Brand, with clean, modern UI. Optimize for Replit: Use Replit Database for initial storage (switch to MongoDB Atlas later), handle deployments with Replit's built-in hosting, and integrate secrets for API keys (e.g., Gemini key). Break down: Checkpoint 1: Project setup and auth. Checkpoint 2: User pages. Checkpoint 3: Admin panel. Checkpoint 4: AI and extras.
