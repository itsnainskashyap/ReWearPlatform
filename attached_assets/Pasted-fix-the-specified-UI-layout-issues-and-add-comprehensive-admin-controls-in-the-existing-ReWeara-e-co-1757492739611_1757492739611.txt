fix the specified UI/layout issues and add comprehensive admin controls in the existing ReWeara e-commerce platform's frontend (React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS) and backend (Node/Express, MongoDB). Proceed iteratively with checkpoints: Start by debugging overlaps/mashups/visibility (inspect via dev tools, fix CSS globally), then enhance buttons/text/sidebar/bubbles, and finally integrate all missing admin features/controls for shop/products (ensure no fakes, real-time API sync). Use positive, direct language; reference theme (#0B5A3A dark green); test mobile/desktop; output fixed code snippets; verify no regressions (Lighthouse audit >90).
Checkpoint 1: Fix Search Bar & Header Overlaps/Mashups with Padding
Issue: Search bar/header scrolls and overlaps/mashups page content (e.g., hero/shop grid), causing clutter.
Fix: Set search bar/header to fixed (top:0, z-index:50), add body/main padding-top (pt-16 mobile/pt-20 desktop). Prevent mashup with overflow-hidden on parent, smooth-scroll-padding. If absolute, adjust positions dynamically.
Test: Search/scroll on Shop/Home; verify no overlap (content below header/search).
Code Snippet (globals.css/layout):
header, .search-bar { /* Group fixes */
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 50;
  background: #FFFFFF;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
main {
  padding-top: 4rem; /* Adjust based on header height */
  @media (min-width: 768px) { padding-top: 5rem; }
}
html { scroll-padding-top: 4rem; } /* No mashup on anchors */
Checkpoint 2: Add Dark Green Edges to Button Borders
Issue: Buttons lack colored borders.
Fix: All buttons (Buy Now, +, CTAs) get border-2 border-[#0B5A3A], rounded-xl. Hover: border-[#0B5A3A]/80 with glow. Apply globally via Tailwind extend.
Test: Check all pages; verify green edges/contrast.
Code Snippet (Tailwind config/ProductCard):
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = { theme: { extend: { borderColor: { 'dark-green': '#0B5A3A' } } } };
<button className="... border-2 border-dark-green hover:border-dark-green/80 ...">Buy Now</button>
<button className="... border-2 border-dark-green rounded-full ..."><Plus /></button>
Checkpoint 3: Fix Text Visibility Issues
Issue: Low text visibility (contrast/overlaps) in many places (titles, desc, filters, nav).
Fix: Global text-[#0B5A3A] on light bg, text-white on dark; add p-2 padding, text-shadow 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); overlays bg-opacity-70 with blur. Scan all components.
Test: Lighthouse contrast pass; scroll/check visibility.
Code Snippet (globals.css):
body { color: #0B5A3A; text-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); }
.text-section { padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); backdrop-filter: blur(4px); }
Checkpoint 4: Fix Sidebar Navigation (Normal, Non-Translucent, Left Side)
Issue: Translucent nav, buggy.
Fix: Left-0 position, bg-white opacity-100 (no translucency), slide-in (Framer x: -100% to 0). Vertical links with p-4 padding, no overlap.
Test: Open/close; verify solid, left-aligned.
Code Snippet (Sidebar.jsx):
<motion.div className="fixed left-0 top-0 h-full w-64 bg-white z-40 shadow-lg" initial={{ x: '-100%' }} animate={{ x: 0 }}>
  <ul className="p-4 space-y-4"><li><a className="text-[#0B5A3A]">About</a></li></ul>
</motion.div>
Checkpoint 5: Make Right Side Bubbles Floating (Fixed, No Scroll)
Issue: Bubbles scroll.
Fix: Fixed position right-4 bottom-20 z-60, no transform on scroll. Stack space-y-2, rounded-full with shadow.
Test: Scroll; verify fixed on right.
Code Snippet (Bubbles.jsx):
<div className="fixed right-4 bottom-20 z-60 space-y-2">
  <button className="w-12 h-12 bg-white border-2 border-[#0B5A3A] rounded-full shadow-md">Icon</button>
</div>
Checkpoint 6: Add/Complete All Missing Admin Controls for Shop Features & Products
Missing in Product Add: Fields for brand/logo assignment, size/condition badges, fabric/measurements/wash care (accordion data), eco-badges (toggle), related products (manual/AI link), images (multi-upload with preview/crop), discounts (%/fixed, expiry), stock alerts (threshold email), categories/filters (multi-select), Thrift/Originals toggle.
Missing in Admin Panel Overall: Full shop controls—filters/sorting CRUD (add options like new categories), trending/hot sections (pin products, auto-sales based), brand management (logos upload/reorder/visibility), search autocomplete config (fuzzy threshold), infinite scroll settings (load limit). Analytics for shop (views/clicks per product/brand). Preview mode for shop layouts. Bulk actions (e.g., discount apply to category). Missing integrations: AI prompts for product desc gen, UPI verification logs.
Fix: Add dedicated sections (e.g., "Shop Settings" tab with forms/tables); ensure CRUD for all (e.g., product form with all fields, validation). Real-time sync via API/WebSockets.
Test: Add product with all fields; verify shop display. Check all shop features controllable (e.g., add brand logo → shows in shop row).
Code Snippet (Admin Product Form):
<form>
  <input placeholder="Title" required />
  <select multiple> {/* Categories */}
    <option>Thrift</option><option>Originals</option>
  </select>
  <input placeholder="Fabric/Measurements/Wash Care" /> {/* Accordion JSON */}
  <input type="file" multiple /> {/* Images preview */}
  <input placeholder="Discount %" />
  {/* Add all missing: badges, stock alert, etc. */}
  <button>Save</button>
</form>
Final Checkpoint: Audit UI (no overlaps/visibility issues), admin (all shop/product controls work, no misses); redeploy, test full flows.
